# Predicting Market Value of Motorcycles

As a motorbike enthusiast, I want to ensure that I am buying my motorbike at market value...Ideally less. 

This is a script that collects data from a classified advertisement page "Kijiji" to create a database for all motorcyles in ontario. Then a predictive model to identify motorcyles undervalued relative to market value.
